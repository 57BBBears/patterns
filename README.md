# Design patterns #


## Creational patterns ## 

**Abstract factory** - creates objects which somehow deal with each other. 
The simplest implementation consist of a few fabric methods, more complex factory
may content logic. Allows abstracting from concrete objects in code.

**Builder** - is used for building complex objects when the process of building consists 
of multiple steps. Allows creating even different objects with the same steps by 
delegating a building process to builders. Director only define a consistency of steps.

**Prototype** - creates objects by cloning them. The pattern can be used when we don't 
know about an object class (got it transferred from somewhere) or initialization 
process is complicated.


## Behavioral patterns ##

**Visitor** - implements double dispatch principle. Pattern is used when we have limited 
 amount of objects and multiple interfaces. Allows adding actions upon objects without
editing ones.


## Structural patterns ##

**Adapter** - adapts classes with incompatible interfaces to make possible the 
communication between them.

**Bridge** - decouples abstraction and implementation. Allows extending both 
independently. Can be used when a class may be extended in different ways.

**Decorator** - adds new functionality to a function or to an object without changing 
other same class objects.
