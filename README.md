**Programming patterns.**

**Abstract factory** - creates objects which somehow deal with each other. 
The simplest implementation consist of a few fabric methods, more complex factory
may content logic. Allows abstracting from concrete objects in code.

**Visitor** - implements double dispatch principle. Pattern is used when we have limited 
 amount of objects and multiple interfaces. Allows adding actions upon objects without
editing ones.
